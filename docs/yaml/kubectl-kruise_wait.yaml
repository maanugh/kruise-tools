description: |-
    Experimental: Wait for a specific condition on one or many resources.

     The command takes multiple resources and waits until the specified condition is seen in the Status field of every given resource.

     Alternatively, the command can wait for the given set of resources to be deleted by providing the "delete" keyword as the value to the --for flag.

     A successful message will be printed to stdout indicating when the specified condition has been met. You can use -o option to change to output destination.
usage: kubectl-kruise wait ([-f FILENAME] | resource.group/resource.name | resource.group [(-l label | --all)]) [--for=delete|--for condition=available|--for=jsonpath='{}'=value]
options:
    - name: all
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Select all resources in the namespace of the specified resource types
    - name: all-namespaces
      shorthand: A
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.

      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    - name: field-selector
      usage: |
        Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.

      default_value: '[]'
      usage: identifying the resource.
    - name: for
      usage: |
        The condition to wait on: [delete|condition=condition-name[=condition-value]|jsonpath='{JSONPath expression}'=JSONPath Condition]. The default condition-value is true.  Condition values are compared after Unicode simple case folding, which is a more general form of case-insensitivity.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for wait
    - name: local
      default_value: "false"

        If true, annotation will NOT contact api-server but run locally.
    - name: output
      shorthand: o
      usage: |
        Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).
    - name: recursive
      shorthand: R
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    - name: selector
      shorthand: l
      usage: |
        Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
    - name: show-managed-fields
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    - name: template
      usage: |
        Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
    - name: timeout
      default_value: 30s
      usage: |
        The length of time to wait before giving up.  Zero means check once and don't wait, negative means wait for a week.
