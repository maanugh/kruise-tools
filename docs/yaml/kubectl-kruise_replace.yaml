synopsis: Replace a resource by file name or stdin
description: |-
    Replace a resource by file name or stdin.

     JSON and YAML formats are accepted. If replacing an existing resource, the complete resource spec must be provided. This can be obtained by

      $ kubectl get TYPE NAME -o yaml
usage: kubectl-kruise replace -f FILENAME
options:
    - name: allow-missing-template-keys
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    - name: cascade
      default_value: background
      usage: |
        Must be "background", "orphan", or "foreground". Selects the deletion cascading strategy for the dependents (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController). Defaults to background.
    - name: dry-run
      default_value: none
      usage: |
        Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
    - name: field-manager
      default_value: kubectl-replace
      usage: Name of the manager used to track field ownership.
    - name: filename
      shorthand: f
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: to use to replace the resource.
    - name: force
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
    - name: grace-period
      default_value: "-1"
      usage: |
        Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for replace
    - name: kustomize
      shorthand: k
      usage: |
        Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
    - name: output
      shorthand: o
      usage: |
        Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).
    - name: raw
      usage: |
        Raw URI to PUT to the server.  Uses the transport specified by the kubeconfig file.
    - name: recursive
      shorthand: R
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    - name: save-config
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
    - name: show-managed-fields
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    - name: subresource
      usage: |
        If specified, replace will operate on the subresource of the requested object. Must be one of [status scale]. This flag is alpha and may change in the future.
    - name: template
      usage: |
        Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
    - name: timeout
      default_value: 0s
      usage: |
        The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
    - name: validate
      default_value: strict
      usage: |-
        Must be one of: strict (or true), warn, ignore (or false).
        		"true" or "strict" will use a schema to validate the input and fail the request if invalid. It will perform server side validation if ServerSideFieldValidation is enabled on the api-server, but will fall back to less reliable client-side validation if not.
        		"warn" will warn about unknown or duplicate fields without blocking the request if server-side field validation is enabled on the API server, and behave as "ignore" otherwise.
        		"false" or "ignore" will not perform any schema validation, silently dropping any unknown or duplicate fields.
    - name: wait
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.
