name: kubectl-kruise scale
synopsis: |
    Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, CloneSet, or Advanced StatefulSet
description: |-
    Set a new size for a deployment, replica set, replication controller, or stateful set.

     Scale also allows users to specify one or more preconditions for the scale action.

     If --current-replicas or --resource-version is specified, it is validated before the scale is attempted, and it is guaranteed that the precondition holds true when the scale is sent to the server.
usage: kubectl-kruise scale [--resource-version=version] [--current-replicas=count] --replicas=COUNT (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME)
options:
    - name: all
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Select all resources in the namespace of the specified resource types
    - name: allow-missing-template-keys
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
    - name: current-replicas
      default_value: "-1"
      usage: |
        Precondition for current size. Requires that the current size of the resource match this value in order to scale. -1 (default) for no condition.
    - name: dry-run
      default_value: none
      usage: |
        Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
    - name: filename
      shorthand: f
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to set a new size
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for scale
    - name: kustomize
      shorthand: k
      usage: |
        Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
    - name: output
      shorthand: o
      usage: |
        Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).
    - name: record
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
    - name: recursive
      shorthand: R
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
    - name: replicas
      default_value: "0"
      usage: The new desired number of replicas. Required.
    - name: resource-version
      usage: |
        Precondition for resource version. Requires that the current resource version match this value in order to scale.
    - name: selector
      shorthand: l
      usage: |
        Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2). Matching objects must satisfy all of the specified label constraints.
    - name: show-managed-fields
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
    - name: template
      usage: |
        Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
    - name: timeout
      default_value: 0s
      usage: |
        The length of time to wait before giving up on a scale operation, zero means don't wait. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).
inherited_options:
    - name: as
      usage: |
        Username to impersonate for the operation. User could be a regular user or a service account in a namespace.
    - name: as-group
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
