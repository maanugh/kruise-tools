name: kubectl-kruise diff
synopsis: Diff the live version against a would-be applied version
description: |-
    Diff configurations specified by file name or stdin between the current online configuration, and the configuration as it would be if applied.

     The output is always YAML.

     KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable can be used to select your own diff command. Users can use external commands with params too, example: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="colordiff -N -u"

     By default, the "diff" command available in your path will be run with the "-u" (unified diff) and "-N" (treat absent files as empty) options.

     Exit status: 0 No differences were found. 1 Differences were found. >1 Kubectl or diff failed with an error.

     Note: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF, if used, is expected to follow that convention.
